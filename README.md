For this assignment, I created a web form aimed at Business Analytics and Information Systems (BAIS) students to gather their feedback and experiences. This task allowed me to apply what I've learned about HTML and CSS, focusing on making a form that's easy and accessible for everyone to use. I put a lot of thought into making sure the form is straightforward and user-friendly.

I made sure all the questions in the form were clear and avoided any confusing terms so that anyone could understand them. The form's layout goes from general questions to more specific ones, and similar questions are grouped together. This makes it easier for users to follow along and stay engaged. To help users fill out the form correctly, I added checks that immediately let users know if they've entered something wrong, like an email address in the wrong format.

Accessibility was a key part of my project. I wanted to make sure that everyone, including people with disabilities, could use the form without trouble. So, I included descriptions for all images for those using screen readers, chose colors that are easy to read, and made sure you could navigate the form using just a keyboard.

By incorporating these features, my goal was to make a form that's not just useful and nice to look at but also welcoming and easy for everyone to fill out. Working on this project taught me a lot about the importance of designing with the user in mind.
